The project is an online shopping application that serves as my final coursework for college. 
It's constructed using a diverse technology stack including React.js for the frontend, ASP.NET Core 6 for the backend, and Ocelot for API Gateway functionalities.
This combination of technologies allows for a scalable and robust solution, suitable for demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of modern web development practices.
The application supports features typical of e-commerce platforms, such as product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication, to name a few.
